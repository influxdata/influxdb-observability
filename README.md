# InfluxDB Observability

This repository is a reference for converting observability signals (traces, metrics, logs) to/from a common InfluxDB schema.

## Demo

Steps to run the current demo follow.

In an InfluxDB Cloud 2 account backed by IOx, create a bucket named `otel` and a token with permission to read and write to that bucket.

In demo/docker-compose.yml, set values for these keys.
The key `INFLUXDB_BUCKET_ARCHIVE` is optional;
if set, it should point to an InfluxDB bucket with longer retention policy than `INFLUXDB_BUCKET`,
so that the "Archive Trace" button in Jaeger works properly:
```yaml
INFLUXDB_ADDR: <region specific hostname - no https prefix>
INFLUXDB_BUCKET: otel
INFLUXDB_BUCKET_ARCHIVE: otel-archive
INFLUXDB_TOKEN: <the API token you just created>
```

In demo/otelcol-config.yml, set the similar values for these keys:
```yaml
endpoint: https://< region specific URL - https://region.csp.cloud2.influxdata.com/ >
bucket: otel
token: <the API token you just created>
```

Build the needed docker images:
```console
$ docker compose --file demo/docker-compose.yml --project-directory . build
```

Run the docker compose:
```console
$ docker compose --file demo/docker-compose.yml --project-directory . up --abort-on-container-exit --remove-orphans
```

Traces are generated by "HotRod", an application designed to demonstrate tracing.
Browse to HotRod at http://localhost:8080 and click some buttons to trigger trace activity.

Query those traces.
Browse to Jaeger at http://localhost:16686 and click "Find Traces" near the bottom left.

Click any trace.

View the dependency graph.
Click "System Architecture".

The images `otelcol-influxdb` and `jaeger-influxdb` are automatically built and pushed to Docker at https://hub.docker.com/r/jacobmarble/otelcol-influxdb and https://hub.docker.com/r/jacobmarble/jaeger-influxdb .

## Schema Reference

[Schema reference with conversion tables](docs/index.md).

## Modules

### `common`

The golang package `common` contains simple utilities and common string values,
used in at least two of the above-mentioned packages.

### `otel2influx` and `influx2otel`

The golang package [`otel2influx`](otel2influx/README.md) converts OpenTelemetry protocol buffer objects to (measurement, tags, fields, timestamp) tuples.
It is imported by [the OpenTelemetry Collector InfluxDB exporter](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/main/exporter/influxdbexporter)
and by [the Telegraf OpenTelemetry input plugin](https://github.com/influxdata/telegraf/tree/master/plugins/inputs/opentelemetry).

The golang package [`influx2otel`](influx2otel/README.md) converts (measurement, tags, fields, timestamp) tuples to OpenTelemetry protocol buffer objects.
It is imported by [the OpenTelemtry Collector InfluxDB receiver](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/main/receiver/influxdbreceiver)
and by [the Telegraf OpenTelemetry output plugin](https://github.com/influxdata/telegraf/tree/master/plugins/outputs/opentelemetry).

### `jaeger-influxdb`

The [Jaeger Query Plugin for InfluxDB](jaeger-influxdb) enables querying traces stored in InfluxDB/IOx via the Jaeger UI.

### `tests-integration`

The golang package `tests-integration` contains integration tests.
These tests exercise the above packages against OpenTelemetry Collector Contrib and Telegraf.

To run these tests:
```console
$ cd tests-integration
$ go test
```

## Contributing

Changes can be tested on a local branch using the `run-checks.sh` tool.
`run-checks.sh` verifies `go mod tidy` using `git diff`,
so any changes must be staged for commit in order for `run-checks.sh` to pass.

To update all OpenTelemetry dependencies in the various modules of this repository:
- run `update-otel.sh`
- stage the changed `go.mod` and `go.sum` files
- run `run-checks.sh`
